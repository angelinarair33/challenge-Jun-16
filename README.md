# Challenge June 16

## Description

The application's original html had mostly non-semantic elements which I changed to semantic elements and put in a logical order. I added alt attributes to each of the images and icons. I also put the heading attributes in sequential order by changinbg the footer to h4. I also changed the title to "Horiseon Learning" in order to give the website a more descriptive title.

## Screenshot

Here is my screenshot, except when I screenshot the website, the screenshot's navbar looks different from how the actual website's navbar looks.
